## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of 6 machine learning models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
